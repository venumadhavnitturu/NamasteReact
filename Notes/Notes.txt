Namaste React Notes - 
JSX :
JSX is not HTML in JavaScript.
JSX will be transpiling to React.createElement end of the day.
JSX -> React.createElement -> JavaScriptObject -> HTML Element.
In JSX class name need to write like className="", In html we write class="" like this.
ALl this transpiling is done by Babel.
Inside JSX you can write JavaScript inside curly braces {}, whatever you write inside {} this will be sanitized and compiled.

What is the component ? : 
In two ways we can create React Components. 
Class based component. OLD 
Functional based component. NEW
What is Component Composition ?
